GAMAN: Gated Attention Unit and Mask Attention Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting
This repository contains the implementation of GAMAN, a deep learning framework for short-term traffic flow prediction. GAMAN combines Gated Attention Units (GAU) for temporal modeling and masked attention for spatial dependencies, achieving high performance, computational efficiency, and interpretability on real-world datasets like PeMSD4 and PeMSD8.
